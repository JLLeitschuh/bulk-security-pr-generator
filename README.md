# Bulk Security Pull Request Generator

Used to generate bulk pull requests (PRs) against projects to fix security vulnerabilities.

These 'bulk fixes' are done as a part of the new [GitHub Security Lab](https://securitylab.github.com/) Bug Bounty Program.

Data is sourced from queries on [lgtm.com](https://lgtm.com) and used to create bulk pull-requests to fix these security
vulnerabilities.

### Features

 - Built-in crash recovery -- Saves state during execution to allow recovering from a crash
 - Records metrics -- Files fixed, Number of Fixes, PR URLs
 - Fast -- Asynchronous IO using python async API

[Want to take over the Java ecosystem? All you need is a MITM!](https://medium.com/@jonathan.leitschuh/want-to-take-over-the-java-ecosystem-all-you-need-is-a-mitm-1fc329d898fb?source=friends_link&sk=3c99970c55a899ad9ef41f126efcde0e)

This project has been used to generate PRs that automatically fix a security vulnerability in Maven POM files that
are using HTTP instead of HTTPS to resolve dependencies.

## Project 2: CVE-2019-16303 - JHipster Vulnerability Fix - Use CSPRNG in RandomUtil

In 2019, I discovered a vulnerability in the [JHipster](https://www.jhipster.tech/) code generator where it was
generating vulnerable implementations of a class called `RandomUtil.java`.
  
Using one password reset token from these apps combined with the POC below, an attacker can determine all future password
reset tokens to be generated by these vulnerable servers.
This would allow an attacker to pick and choose what account they would like to takeover by sending account password reset requests for targeted accounts.

[POC code](http://web.archive.org/web/20191126104359/https://medium.com/@alex91ar/the-java-soothsayer-a-practical-application-for-insecure-randomness-c67b0cd148cd) has existed since March 3rd, 2018 for taking one RNG value generated by `RandomStringUtils` and reversing it to generate all of the past/future RNG values.

The fix was generated for each vulnerable file, preserving the original style of the file, by the [Rewrite project](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite).
See the specific code for this fix [here](https://github.com/moderneinc/jhipster-cwe-338).
