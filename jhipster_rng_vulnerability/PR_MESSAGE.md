[SECURITY] CVE-2019-16303 - JHipster Vulnerability Fix - Use CSPRNG in RandomUtil

---

This is a security fix for a  vulnerability in your [JHipster](https://www.jhipster.tech/) generated `RandomUtil.java` file(s).

## Technical Impact

Using one password reset token from your app combined with the POC below, an attacker can determine all future password reset tokens to be generated by this server. This allows an attacker to pick and choose what account they would like to takeover by sending account password reset requests for targeted accounts.

A version of JHipster Generator that was vulnerable to [CVE-2019-16303](https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-kotlin/security/advisories/GHSA-j3rh-8vwq-wh84) was used to generate this project.
This version of JHipster generated code using an insecure source of randomness in security sensitive locations.

This class of vulnerability is better known as [CWE-338: Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/338.html).

This vulnerability has a CVSS v3.0 Base Score of [9.8/10](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?name=CVE-2019-16303&vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H&version=3.1&source=NIST).

[POC code](http://web.archive.org/web/20191126104359/https://medium.com/@alex91ar/the-java-soothsayer-a-practical-application-for-insecure-randomness-c67b0cd148cd) has existed since March 3rd, 2018 for taking one RNG value generated by `RandomStringUtils` and reversing it to generate all of the past/future RNG values.

This contribution is a part of a submission to the [GitHub Security Lab](https://securitylab.github.com/) Bug Bounty program.
